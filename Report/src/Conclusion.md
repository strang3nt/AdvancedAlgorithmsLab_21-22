# Conclusion

The results obtained on the three different algorithms respect the theoretical 
complexities. Part of the small variations present in the graphs is due to 
the presence of the garbage collector, which can't be totally disabled in the 
`F#` programming language, but can only be set in a "high latency" mode.
