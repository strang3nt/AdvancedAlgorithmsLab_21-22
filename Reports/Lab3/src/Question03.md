# Comment on the results obtained

Both of the algorithms behave with respect to the various instances according 
to their theoretical time complexity, namely *KargerStein* is $O(n^2\log^3(n))$ 
and *StoerWagner* is $O(mn\log(n))$; hence from their theoretical complexity 
and as confirmed in \ref{fig:comparison} *StoerWagner* is more efficient and 
always faster than *KargerStein*.
