# Conclusion

Some closing remarks about `F#`: we started these series of assignments willing to
tackle them in a "functional" and "pure" paradigm of programming, very soon we 
understood that it wasn't possible. A "pure function" sometimes is not possible nor
achievable and side effects are preferred, we weren't 
able to use immutable and persistent structures, all in the name of performance.

We appreciated `F#` mixed approach to functional programming, the language designers
were able to offer a declarative language, successfully mixing it with typically 
imperative and object oriented entities, which allowed us to continue using this language.
Thanks to the already existing dotnet standard library, `F#` is a mature language
with which we were able to successfully complete all the assignments.
