# Comments on the results

## How do the algorithms behave with respect to the various instances? 

## Is there an algorithm that always manages to do better than the others with respect to the approximation error? 

As it can be seen from \ref{fig:error-comparison} the Closest Insertion 
heuristic in each instance has the lowest approximation error between the 
algorithms analyzed

## Which of the three algorithms you have implemented is more efficient?
