# Conclusion

## Clean and expressive code

We think that the choice of using a functional language led to the 
development of a clean code base, where code is succinct and self explanatory, 
which implies a reduced possibility of introducing error and 
bugs in the implementations of the methods.

## Code reuse

Thanks to the common structure underlying the different constructive 
heuristics we were able to reuse the same code for different algorithms and 
it could have been even more effective if there wasn't the boundary of 
implementing only two heuristics. Moreover we were able to reuse the code 
developed for the previous assignment without any change, the small 
modifications were done only for improving efficiency of the algorithms that 
we had to implement this time.
